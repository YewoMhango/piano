# Piano

This is a browser-based piano app.

# Possible Future Features

- Ability to choose from multiple key mappings and custom key mapping
- Recording, both audio as well as keystrokes as in MIDI

# Git LFS

You'll probably need to install [Git LFS (Large File Storage)](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to interact with this repository using Git as the _.ogg_ audio files occupy a lot of space, which might cause errors when cloning, etc.
